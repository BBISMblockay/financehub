# `/v3/` — the dashboard runtime

This folder is not a rewrite of SILO and not a second app. It is one feature
that needed its own directory: a **visualization runtime** that renders saved
configuration. Pages here load the v2 Beacon shell (`../v2/beacon.css`,
`nav-config.js`, `silo-chrome.js`) exactly like a v2 Pattern 1 page, and they
read `window.__SILO_CONFIG__` and talk to Supabase the same way.

## The idea in one line

A dashboard is **not stored as HTML**. It is stored as rows:

```
saved Ask SILO report  →  which of its queries  →  which visual  →  where on the grid
silo_chat_saved_reports    dashboard_widgets.query_index    .visual_type/.visual_config    .layout
```

Switching a tile from a table to a bar chart is a one-field update and a
re-render. It is not a new page, not an LLM call, and not a deploy.

## Why there is no new `saved_reports` table

SILO already has one. `silo_chat_saved_reports` (migration `20260818050000`)
stores a question, the answer, and the exact SQL (`queries_run`) that produced
it, and Ask SILO's "Refresh data" button already re-runs that SQL client-side
through `chat_run_readonly_query`. A widget is just *that report + which query
+ how to draw it*. A parallel table would have forked the one artifact Ask SILO
produces and split refresh behaviour across two code paths.

`chat_run_readonly_query` is `SECURITY INVOKER`, so every widget query is
scoped by the viewer's own RLS. **A dashboard can never show someone data they
could not already query themselves.** It also caps results at 500 rows and
statements at 30s — both surface in the UI rather than being silently absorbed.

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `dashboards.html` | List / create dashboards |
| `dashboard.html` | The canvas. `?id=<uuid>` to view, `&edit=1` to edit |
| `dashboard.css` | Tile chrome, inspector, picker. Beacon tokens only — no new CSS variables |
| `js/chart-adapter.js` | The only file that talks to ECharts. Profiles rows, recommends a visual, shapes data, builds options, renders table/KPI HTML |
| `js/dashboard-renderer.js` | Owns the GridStack instance and draws widgets from config. Used unchanged in view **and** edit mode |
| `js/dashboard-builder.js` | Edit mode only: report picker, inspector, buffered save |

Libraries are CDN-loaded and version-pinned: GridStack 10.3.1 (canvas
interactions) and ECharts 5.5.1 (charts).

## Tables

`dashboards` and `dashboard_widgets` (migration `20260828120000_v3_dashboards.sql`),
plus the `dashboards_v` / `dashboard_widgets_v` `security_invoker` views. RLS
follows the existing company-membership model; widget access is entirely
inherited from the parent dashboard via an `EXISTS`.

## Decisions worth knowing before changing this

- **`query_index` exists because `queries_run` is an array.** A saved answer
  often ran several queries; a widget draws exactly one. The picker asks which
  when there is a choice rather than silently taking the first.
- **Editing is buffered, not live.** Add / configure / remove change local
  state; one Save writes the set. Widget ids are minted client-side so that set
  goes back as a single idempotent upsert — re-saving after a failure does not
  duplicate tiles.
- **Sort / limit are applied to returned rows, not pushed into SQL.** The widget
  does not rewrite its report's query, and the UI says so. A tile whose query
  hit the 500-row cap says that too — a silently truncated chart is a quiet lie.
- **`recommend()` prefers bar over donut.** Few rows is not evidence of a
  composition: a top-4-products query has few rows and is a *ranking*. Donut is
  suggested only when the dimension's name says composition (channel, location,
  type, …). Bar is never actively misleading, only sometimes less expressive.
- **Currency inference checks count-words first.** `total_units` is a count, not
  dollars; `net_sales` is dollars. Formatting a unit count as currency is a
  wrong number on a dashboard, not a cosmetic slip.
- **Palette is explicit hex, not the beacon `oklch()` tokens.** ECharts/zrender
  parses colours to derive hover shades and its parser predates `oklch()`, so a
  token read off `:root` comes back null and hover states render transparent.
- **Watch the `[hidden]` trap.** Any class here that sets `display` needs an
  explicit `[hidden] { display: none }` rule — the UA rule loses to an
  author-stylesheet class of equal specificity. `beacon.css` documents the same
  trap for `.bcn-btn`; `.v3-blank` and `.v3-meta-bar` both hit it during build.

## Deliberately not built yet

Named here so nobody reads their absence as an oversight:

- **Dashboard-level filters** (date range, location, entity). These want to push
  down into the report's SQL to be honest, and the SQL is opaque text a widget
  does not own. Filtering the 500 returned rows client-side would look like a
  filter and behave like a sample.
- **An "Add to dashboard" button inside Ask SILO.** The hop exists in the other
  direction (the picker reads saved reports); adding the outbound button means
  editing `v2/silo-chat.html`, which is its own change.
- **Cross-widget interactions** (click a bar to filter the rest), scheduled
  email/export, and dashboard duplication.
- **AI-authored widget config.** The natural next step — Ask SILO already
  returns `queries_run`, and `visual_config` is a small JSON object, so
  "chart that by units instead" is a field edit, not generated code. The
  deterministic `recommend()` in `chart-adapter.js` is the placeholder for it.

## Testing

`chart-adapter.js` is pure and testable in node (no DOM needed for profiling,
shaping or formatting). The full path — add a report, switch Table ↔ Bar ↔ Line
↔ Donut ↔ KPI, drag/resize, save, reload identically — was verified in Chromium
against a stubbed Supabase client during development. There is no test runner
checked into this repo to hang those on yet; see `docs/ops/roadmap.md` (smoke
tests).
